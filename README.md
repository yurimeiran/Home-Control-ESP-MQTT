# Home-Control-ESP-MQTT
Very basic home automation project with web-intrface, ESP8266 and RF 433 Mhz modules, i.e. relays, light switches, etc.
Web intrface is written using PHP, JQuery and JavaScript. W3 css chosen for design. 
Basically this is a web page, with buttons and switches, which allow to control ligths and sockets. Communication between modules achieved 
using MQTT messaging. RF 433Mhz modules controlled using ESP Witty Cloud module and RF transmitter module.
I will add more description as project will develop (if will).
